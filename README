JarExploder is a simple java class which enables packing of jar files and other files within
a simple jar file which can be started with the -jar flag.

To use the JarExploder, package all your project files and within a simple jar file. Place the
JarExploder class in the jar-file root and mark it as the Main-Class in the jar MANIFEST. Specify
your real main class in the MANIFEST as the Start-Class.

For example:
cms-system.jar/
+ se/
  + softhouse/
    + jar/
      + JarExploder.class
+ lib/
  + cms-system-20121231.jar
  + apache-commons-1.0.jar
  - other-3rd-party.jar
+ icons/
  + ....
  
In the MANIFEST:
Main-Class: se.softhouse.jar.JarExploder
Start-Class: se.softhouse.cms.Start

The JarExploder will uncompress all files in the jar and place it in a temporary folder in the file
system. All .jar files will be added to the classpath and the Start-Class main method will be invoked.
When the jvm exists, all temporary files will be deleted.

To enable debugging printouts, add -DDEBUG=true to the command line argument.

The JarExploder can also be used to embedd a jarfile in another project. For instance if java is to be started
as a service.
